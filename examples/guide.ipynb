    "## Pre-requisite\n",
    "- A computer with Windows OS\n",
    "- Miniconda or Anaconda installed (https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/)\n",
    "- Visual Studio Code installed (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)\n",
    "- Git installed (https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)\n",

    "## Setup the Software for Motor\n",
    "### Install Thorlabs Kinesis\n",
    "Install the Kinesis here: https://www.thorlabs.com/software_pages/ViewSoftwarePage.cfm?Code=Motion_Control&viewtab=0\n",
    "- You should install the x64 version\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setup Virtal COM Port\n",
    "This step is needed for using Python to connect to the motor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Plug-in the USB cable. Then open `Device Manager`, find the `APT USB Device` under `Universal Serial Bus Controller`, right click and select properties. Then go to `Advanced` tab and tick `Load VCP`. You should then unplug and plug-in the USB cable again to make the change effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Check if the COM port is created properly: it should be displayed in \"COM & LPT\" tab after you plug in the USB cable again.\n",

    "### Confirm the Motor Is Working\n",
    "Open `Kinesis`, then click `Move` for your motor, then set any number as position. Make sure it is moving as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Callibration\n",
    "You should callibrate positions to zero for your motor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Open `Kinesis`, then click `Home` for your motor and make sure you get zero on both the motor and the display. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup the Software for Spectrometer\n",
    "There is no need to setup the Virtual COM Port for the spectrometer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Avasoft and AvaSpecDLL\n",
    "You can download the software to drive the spectrometer from Canvas (`Avantes.zip`). **Unfortunately, you have to uninstall the software after the session as the software is not free.**\n",
    "- `Avasoft86Setup.exe`: Install Avasoft 8. \n",
    "- `AvaSpec-DLL/AvaSpecDLLsetup64.exe`: Install AvaSpecDLL. You can find the password in the pdf file in the zip.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Confirm the Spectrometer Is Working\n",
    "You have done this in your previous Lab session: Connect your computer to the spectrometer using the USB cable. Then open `Avasoft 8` and check if the spectrometer is working: Click `Start` and tick `Autoscale Y-axis`. You should see a spectrum."
